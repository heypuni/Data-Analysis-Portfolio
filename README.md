# Gabby Evalin - Data Science Portfolio

## About Me
Hi, I'm Gabby!<br>
<br>
This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects, and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
### Python <br>
1. Designing a Customer-Centric Product to Reduce Attrition in a Major Bank
   
Code: Click [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RxFchVnNi3ryhdfbXdalMoGSFpyxStiO#scrollTo=FwyyftVZF3bV)


üéØ Goal:  
To identify customer segments using clustering analysis and design targeted banking products that reduce customer attrition.


üìå Description:  
This project analyzes anonymized banking data from a major bank/credit card company to address rising customer attrition. The dataset includes demographic and behavioral attributes such as customer age, credit limit, average monthly spend, total relationship count, and utilization ratio. K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering were used to segment customers into meaningful groups based on behavior. 


üß† Skills:  
Customer segmentation, clustering analysis, business case translation, product design using data, churn reduction strategy.


üß∞ Technology:  
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Google Collab.


üìä Results:  
Using Python-based clustering techniques, the analysis revealed 7 distinct customer segments.  
A product for Cluster 5 (Most profitable, loyal customers): Reward loyalty and increase utilization among high-value, low-risk customers.  
A product for Cluster 1: (High attrition rate and high number of dependent): Due to the high utilization ratio, we need to lower down the interest rate or make long tenure payment so they can keep paying and not be a burden to the family.

2. Predicting Customer Churn Based on Transaction Behavior in a Logistics Platform

üéØ Goal:  
To identify behavioral patterns leading to high churn probability and suggest strategies to retain customers on a logistics-based e-commerce platform.  


üìå Description:  
This project focuses on customer churn prediction by analyzing transactional behavior across different channels and courier services.  
Techniques included exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, and modeling churn probability behavior across service combinations.  


üß† Skills:  
Churn analysis, feature correlation, behavioral segmentation, data visualization, retention strategy.  


üß∞ Technology:  
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Google Collab.   


üìä Results:  
Customers who transacted Food & Beverage and General Items showed higher churn probability, especially when not paired with express or document courier options.    
The churn probability ranged from 0.68 to 1.00, with higher churn associated with a lack of courier diversity and low transaction amounts.   
Bundling certain courier services (e.g., ‚ÄúSame Cities + One Day Service‚Äù) and promoting lower-churn transaction types (e.g., Books/Documents) could help reduce churn by an estimated 12‚Äì18%.

## Certificates  
The best way to showcase skills is by doing and sharing your job well-done but sometimes certificates can be indirect results. Here's a list of the ones I have:

Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate (Coursera - Google)(2025)

Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python (IBM)(2025)
